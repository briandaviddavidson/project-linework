Derived from a 1920 broadside map entitled “The Rights of the People—Women are People: Suffrage Victory Map.” Equal Suffrage League of Virginia Papers, Acc. 22002, Library of Virginia.

Traced, adjusted, and expanded by Daniel P. Huffman.

This linework appears to have been originally designed to fit on an Equidistant Conic projection, with standard parallels at 33º and 45º, and a -96º central meridian.

The original map is included in this archive.

-------
Adjustments to original linework include:

1) a slight rotation to better fit an equidistant conic projection centered at 96W

2) Addition of the District of Columbia

3) Creation of line paths for areas which, on the original map, were obscured by star symbols: the Straits of Mackninac, the Boston area, northern New Hampshire, northern Wisconsin

4) Creation of line paths for areas which were missing on the original map: the IN-OH border, the Ohio border with Lake Erie.
