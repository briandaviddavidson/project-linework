Project Linework
================

Project Linework is a library of handcrafted vector linework for cartography, each one designed in a unique aesthetic style. Itâ€™s meant to break us away from the default line paths that we so often rely on by providing some more visually-interesting alternatives. Download the current files at [projectlinework.org](http://projectlinework.org/). [Learn more](http://projectlinework.org/about/) about Mr. Huffman's inspiration.

## What's included?

Most sets include all of the following:

* **Illustrator**: projected to best fit extent, PDF & Inkscape compatible
* **SVGs**: for web and other vector needs
* **Shapefiles**: great with QGIS or ArcGIS
* **GeoJSON**: Add to your webmaps

Geographic Data (not included in all sets) typically consists of admin0 poly/Line, admin1 poly/Line, streams, lakes, and waterbodies

## Website

The projectlinework.org website is hosted here as well - it's a jekyll website and can be run locally with `jekyll serve --watch`.

## License

[CC0 1.0 Universal](LICENSE). Please credit the author and the project wherever possible.

## Develop

You can convert all shapefiles of a particular linework set by using `convert.sh <linework_set_name>`. In order to convert/update a linework set this way we assume:

1. you have a `/shp` file directory set up in your new linework set with properly formatted Shapefiles
1. you have installed `gdal` on your computer to use `ogr2ogr` to convert shapefiles to GeoJSON
1. you have installed `topojson` globally on your computer to convert GeoJSON files to TopoJSON.

**Deployment is only possible if you have Amazon s3 keys provided to you by the Project Linework maintainers.**
